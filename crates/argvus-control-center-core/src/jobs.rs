//! Implements asynchronous work and cooperative cancellation in crate `argvus control center core`. This separation keeps external effects from contaminating models, routes, or rendering.
//!
//! Jobs are deliberately simple: one thread executes the operation, one channel
//! delivers exactly one result, and the token enables cooperative cancellation.
//! This model keeps slow probes out of the render loop; the
//! screen only reads the state available through `try_state`.
//!
//! External tool dependencies remain in backend layers;
//! the UI consumes normalized models and results.
